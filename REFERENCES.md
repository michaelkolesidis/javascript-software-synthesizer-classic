# References

As developers, a significant proportion of our time is browsing through online developer communities, trying to find solutions to smaller or bigger problems we face, as well as offering our help when we can. This document is an attempt to include (most of) the sources of the chunks of code that were found elsewhere, adapted for, and implemented in this project.

This will be of tremendous help, both for contributors, who will be able to understand the code better, and for other developers who just liked something from the project and would like to implement it in their projects.

Tha main third-party source of code for the project is the documentation of the Tone.js, NexusUI2 and WEBMIDI.js projects, and this is where anyone wishing to implement the project's core functionality should look at first.

## The References List

**Note**: Many of the following chunks of code were heavily modified and sometimes completely changed in our implementation, merely serving as a source of inspiration. You should always refer to our project's codebase first.
